This example includes the same example from the exercise number 17 but in separate source code files

Before calling the go install command, please follow the instructions below
1 - GOPATH should point to 18_creating_packages folder
2 - run go install fullname
3 - go to the bin directory and find the fullname.exe

Notes
If the given file needs to be installed does not have the package name main and function name main,
the package won't get compiled to an executable
