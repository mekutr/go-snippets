# Go Snippets

This project includes small Go snippets for the Go newbies. All the Go files are small enough for you to easily follow them. It also includes my Go notes that I put together while I was learning the language.

## How to use this project?

Each go file is designed to be concise and focus on a specific point of the language without creating a lot of other distractions around it. Since all the files are distinct and self contained, you can make your changes on each file and easily test it by running the ```go run <go_file_name>``` command.
